The webpage mainly contains a form that can be used for submitting user details, including the profile picture to create an online user profile for, say a dating website. It uses a working <form> component with most of the commonly used HTML <form> elements. Appropriate CSS style rules have been applied to make the overall look visually appealing. In addition for fields to enter the textual information, the form also incorporates two interactive features. These are:

1. When the mouse is moved over any <label> or <input> or <select> element, the text in that element becomes bigger, and when    the mouse moves away from the element, the text returns to its normal size.

2. Immediately after the user selects the image of his/her face, the image is shown in the web page. This is performed using      JavaScript code in an external file that is included in the HTML code.
